# Learn-react-with-node
A basic and neat example of a React application with a Node server

As a teacher, and as a beginning developer myself, I saw the student's need to see a basic project running and working, streaming data from the node.js server to the react.js application.
This project gives a basic picture of a project structure, from which basic codes and templates can be copied, for a beginner developer.
To be honest, I wrote the project for me, I like to copy from it, instead of starting all over again,
But I would be happy if it would benefit you too.
